        <h1>üìñ When Special Objects Became Money!</h1>
        <p>Trading food or animals worked, but it wasn‚Äôt easy. People needed something smaller and easier to carry. So, they started using special objects like shells, beads, and shiny stones as money!</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Main Content Section -->
    <section class="content">
        <h2>üêöüíéUsing Special Objects</h2>
        <p>After trading and bartering started, people began to collect the first valuable objects or special items. These objects became popular to keep, trade or show off because they were old, rare or interesting. The special objects later become known as collectibles.</p>
        <img src="images/special-object-3.png" alt="An image of early collectibles">
        <div class="image-caption">‚ÄúAn image of early collectibles that people found valuable because they are rare, cool and special‚Äù</div>
        <p>A collectible didn't need to be useful (like a spoon or a toy you actually play with), but instead people want it because it's:</p>
        <p>Rare - not many exist.</p>
        <p>Old - something from long time ago.</p>
        <p>Special - it has a cool design, a story, or it reminds them of something they love.</p>
        <img src="images/rare-old-special.PNG" alt="An image of text saying rare, old and special">
        <div class="image-caption">Rare, Old & Special.</div>
        <p>You can think of collectibles as ‚Äútreasures‚Äù‚Äîlittle things people find valuable because they are cool, rare, or meaningful, even if they aren‚Äôt needed for everyday life. In the start they used shells, beads, salt or animal teeth because they were rare and valued during those times. An example of this was the use of Cowrie shells, because they were pretty and hard to find.</p>
        <p>So why did these objects work? Well, they worked because the objects were:</p>
        <p>- Easy to carry and store compared to big items like animals.</p>
        <p>- Everyone agreed they were valuable, so that trades could be made simpler.</p>
        <p>- They didn't spoil or break easily, unlike food or fragile items.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Note Section -->
    <section class="note">
        <h3>What About Banks?</h3>
        <p>During this time of money's origin there were still no real banks. People stored their valuables at home or with trusted leaders. But this made trade tricky because you couldn‚Äôt safely keep these objects in one place. Storing your expensive items at home could also bring in the risk of someone stealing it.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Did You Know Section -->
    <section class="conclusion">
        <h3>Did You Know!</h3>
        <p>Some of these collectible items lasted a long time and could be passed down from parents to children - kind of like family treasures. Known as Heirlooms, they were used more to save value than to buy things every day. Even if they were only traded a few times in a person‚Äôs life, they held big meaning and worth.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Family Challenge -->
    <section class="conclusion">
        <h3>Family Challenge!</h3>
        <p>To discover your own ‚Äúheirloom‚Äù story at home, ask your parents (or grandparents) if your family has something special that‚Äôs been kept for many years. It may be a piece of jewelry, an old photo, a book, or even a lucky object.</p>
        <p>- Why is it important to them?</p>
        <p>- Do they think it could be passed down to you one day?</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Conclusion Section -->
    <section class="conclusion">
        <h3>Wrapping Up!</h3>
        <p>Now you know what objects were used as the first kinds of money. After bartering, people started keeping special objects called collectibles.</p>
        <p>- Collectibles were valuable because they were Rare (hard to find), Old (from long ago), Special (cool design, story, or memory).</p>
        <p>- Early examples: shells, beads, salt, were popular because they were pretty, easy to carry, and lasted a long time.</p>
        <p>- Collectibles worked as treasures since: Everyone agreed they had value, They didn‚Äôt spoil or break easily, They were small and easy to trade</p>
        <p>üëâ Collectibles show how people began to see value in things beyond everyday needs ‚Äî little treasures that carried meaning and worth!</p>
